Introduction contains a complete literature review,Provides background research into the topic and summarizes important findings from the review of the literature; describes the problem to be solved; justifies the study; explains the significance of the problem to an audience of non-specialists,Provides some background research into the topic and describes the problem to be solved,Provides an incomplete background; presents background in a superficial manner; insufficient or nonexistent explanation of details to non-specialists,5
Presentation of empirical findings,Data are analyzed completely and appropriately; statistics are appropriate and reported in correct APA format; figures are clear and contain informative captions,"Data are analyzed and reported appropriately, but some secondary analyses may not have been performed; small issues with choices made in data visualization","Data are either incompletely analyzed, or inappropriately analyzed; major errors exist with reporting statistical tests; plots or graphs are incompletely labeled, or have used default parameters that limit their efficacy",10
Discussion reflects effective synthesis,The writer offers insightful interpretation of the empirical research; writer synthesizes the present results in the context of broader literature; the writer provides specific follow-up ideas for the future and ties this section together with a compelling conclusion,"The writer offers interpretation of the research at a somewhat superficial level; attempts are made to synthesize, but somewhat incompletely; follow-up ideas are not fully formed; paper ends rather than is finished","The writer offers little interpretation beyond rephrasing the results; little to no attempt is made at synthesis; the author offers no follow-up ideas, or ideas that are too general to be relevant; conclusion is absent",10
